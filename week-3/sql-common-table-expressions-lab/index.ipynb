CTEs also can simplify the readability of complex SQL queries.  In this lab we will write several CTEs to calculate a dataset's average, then select the inputs that are above that average.  We will also use CTEs to delete duplicate rows from our table."

Recall that Records-R-Sweet had a store in five places: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Washington, Houston, and London.  What if Records-R-Sweet wishes to open a second store in London?  We cannot refer to London twice in our `sales` table, so we have replaced the \"location\" column with a \"location_id\" that refers to a separate `locations` table.
